		<p> <b>What Tools did we use?</b> </p>
	</center>
	<center>

		<p>
			The page utilizes several API's, ranging from
		</p>
	</center>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Leaflet</b>, an open source for API that allowed us to render an interactive map onto our website. Leaflet also allows for add-ons such as a map overlay for a heat map (much like for weather forcasting, in our case we would have done a heat map of certain particles) and allow for markers for certain locations.</li>
		<ul>
			<li> An example of these markers you see are the locations where measurement s of Air Quality are taken.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>MapBox</b> was a included in the tutorial for Leaflet, that proved its worth in our project. Mapboxfor providing updating map tiles for a distinct map style.</li>
		<li><b>LocationIQ</b> is an API that provided the integration for search locations by name or lat/lon. Our search box is able to relay the name, lat. and lon. of the location that is on the center of the map.</li>
		<li><b>Vue</b> is our main framework for this project. Vue allows for data-binding and real time data changes to the users view. The prime example for this is shown by dragging the map around, Vue provides javascript functions to retrieve information for new locations, and reflect the new data on our main table. </li>
		<li><b>Open AQ Platform</b> is a online website that holds a collections of Air Quality data from the past 90 days. Information on where the measurments were taken, time stamps, and certain particles (Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, etc.) are all provided via a API for open use.</li>
